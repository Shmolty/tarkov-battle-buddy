# Tarkov Battle Buddy

**Cross Platform Mobile App for Android and Ios**

## The Purpose
This application is being created as a companion app for the game *Escape from Tarkov* developed by *BattleState Games*. 

The app is meant to provide a convenient/all in one solution to Tarkov's intimidating learning curve as well as the huge variety of items and systems. 

The user will be able to:
- check their stats (and others)
- view maps for the game
- research item information
- get help with tasks
**and much more**

## Tech Stack
This app is being developed using **React Native** along with the **Expo** framework. 

That's all I have been working with so far, but this app is very early in development. 

## Planned Features
- Account creation and user authentication
- Integrate with the Tarkov.dev api for fetching data
- User stats summary
- User search functionality to check other players stats
- Maps screen for help navigating the various maps
- Item lookup screen
- Quest help screen

More will be added as I get further in development.
